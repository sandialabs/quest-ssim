<h1>Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#metrics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Calculation of metrics indicating the quality of a grid configuration is done
by a custom helics federate that communicates with other federates as needed
to get calculated values for quantities of interest.</p>
<p>In the context of this application, a metric consists of</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A value generated periodically during the course of a simulation that is of interest to a user.</p></li>
<li><p>A set of inputs that indicate the user’s goals for that value.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, a user may indicate that they are interested in the voltage
level at a particular bus.  That satisfies item 1 above.  To stipulate their
goals for it, they may indicate that they would like the voltage to remain as
close to 1 p.u. as possible.  That satisfies item 2 above.</p>
<p>The metrics framework allows for three types of metric valuations, also
referred to as “sense” or “improvement type”.  Those are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Minimize</span></code> which indicates that a value is better the smaller it becomes</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Maximize</span></code> which indicates that a value is better the larger it becomes</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Seek</span> <span class="pre">Value</span></code> which indicates that a specific value is sought and the closer
to it the better.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The SSIM metric system must allow for simultaneous evaluation of many,
potentially hundreds, of metrics and to support direct comparison of
different grid configurations to determine which is better.  This allows
search algorithms to perform optimization and supports users who may not be
able to account for hundreds of individual measures manually when deciding
whether or not a solution is good.</p>
<p>To further complicate the situation, many metrics must be accumulated over
time.  Take the example of bus voltage above.  When doing a grid simulation
over a long period of time with changing conditions
(loading, generation, etc.), the voltage at the bus will vary up and down.
It may at times be within tolerances while at others, be out of tolerances.
The metric system must be able to accumulate the “fitness” of a measure such
as voltage that varies with time and support comparison with other time
varying or non-time varying measures.</p>
<p>While it is challenging enough to compare multiple similar metrics between
two different configurations, it can become an impossible task to manually
decide which is a better configuration when there are many, very different
metrics all being tracked.  For example, perhaps a user is interested in
voltage, frequency, reliability, resilience measures, service provision,
operational characteristics of grid assets, load service levels, etc. all
at the same time.  The metric system must allow for sensible evaluation of
configurations over all those performance dimensions to determine which
solutions are better that which others.</p>
<section id="normalization">
<h2>Normalization<a class="headerlink" href="#normalization" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to compare across metrics of different kinds, units, and scales, a
normalization process is used.  This process results in a unitless, scaled
value that can be compared on an equivalent basis to the values calculated for
other metrics.  Without a process such as this, attempting to aggregate metric
values together to create an overall fitness would result in the
disproportionate emphasis on those metrics with greater scale.</p>
<p>For example, if per-unit voltage is on the order of 1, and cost is on the order
of millions of dollars, simpy adding raw values together would result in no
concern for voltage and all empahsis being placed on improving cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the following normalization scheme is implemented in
SSIM.</p>
<p>A family of functional forms representing the normalization method exists, 1
for each of the improvement types (minimize, maximize, and seek value).
Starting with maximization, the equation(s) used, when plotted, produce a curve
as shown below.</p>
<img alt="_images/maxnorm.png" src="_images/maxnorm.png" />
<p>This curve consists of 3 quadratic sections; the section below the limit, the
section between the limit and objective, and the section above the objective.
Each section is C0 and C1 constrained with any other section to which it joins.
There are parameters that can be adjusted to control the details of the shape
of the curve.  Though they are not controllable in SSIM, for completeness and
to give information needed for the equations below, the are</p>
<p>A -Impacts the curvature below the limit</p>
<p>B -Sets the slope at the limit</p>
<p>C -Sets the normalized value (y value) at the limit</p>
<p>G -Impacts the curvature above the objective</p>
<p>The shape of this curve is deliberate.  It has several features that make it
desirable for use in the context of optimization.  They include</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It is continuous (except in the case of the seek value for which there is a discontinuity at the objective value).</p></li>
<li><p>It has a monotonically decreasing slope as the raw response value gets better (effects a diminishing returns scenario and enables sensible trade-offs)</p></li>
<li><p>It effects the desired behavior of penalizing unacceptable values more heavily than it rewards exceptionally good values.</p></li>
<li><p>It is parameterizable particularly in how quickly quality drops as one moves further below the limit or further above the objective.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For minimization, the process is exactly the same but the curve is mirrored
such that the limit is above the objective and the curve goes from higher
values on the left to lower values on the right.</p>
<p>The equations that define the 3 portions of the curve are defined below.  Prior to computing these equations, a pre-normalization is applied to the raw value (x) as follows.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\bar{x}=\frac{x-L}{O-L}\]</div>
<p>Where L is the limit and O is the objective.  The section of the curve used is determined by the value of x relative to the limit and objective.  The equations are as follows:</p>
<p>If x is below the limit:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{-A{\bar{x}}^{\ \mathbf{2}}}{\mathbf{2}}+B\bar{x}+C\]</div>
<p>If x is between the limit and objective:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}\sqrt{\bar{x}+\left[\frac{\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}}{\mathbf{2}B}\right]^\mathbf{2}}+C-\frac{\left[\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}\right]^\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{2}B}\]</div>
<p>If x is above the objective:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[G\sqrt{\bar{x}+\frac{G^\mathbf{2}\left[\left(\frac{\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}}{\mathbf{2}B}\right)^\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{1}\right]}{\left(\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}\right)^\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{1}}-G\sqrt{\frac{G^\mathbf{2}\left[\left(\frac{\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}}{\mathbf{2}B}\right)^\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{1}\right]}{\left(\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}\right)^\mathbf{2}}}+\mathbf{1}\]</div>
<p>The above can be simplified with the following definitions:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[D=\sqrt{B\left(\frac{C^\mathbf{2}-\mathbf{2}C+\mathbf{1}}{C+B-\mathbf{1}}\right)}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[F=\left(\frac{D}{\mathbf{2}B}\right)^\mathbf{2}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[H=\frac{G^\mathbf{2}\left[F+\mathbf{1}\right]}{D^\mathbf{2}}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\psi=\frac{D^\mathbf{2}}{\mathbf{2}B}\]</div>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\varphi=G\sqrt{H}\]</div>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>If x is between the limit and objective:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[D\sqrt{\bar{x}+F}+C-\psi\]</div>
<p>If x is above the objective:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[G\sqrt{\bar{x}+H-\mathbf{1}}-\varphi+\mathbf{1}\]</div>

<section id="overall-process">
<h2>Overall Process<a class="headerlink" href="#overall-process" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the normalization process detailed above, one can not only normalize
individual values, but one can apply a process of integration of those
normalized values over time to arrive at a value that indicates total, overall
fitness over time and over multiple metrics.  The resulting value has no
physical interpretation and is therefore only useful for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Stated another way, one can compute the total fitness for each of multiple
configurations of a distribution grid and use that total fitness value to sort
the configurations by how good they are. The phrase “how good they are” should
be interpreted as meaning “how well they meet your metric objectives overall”.</p>
<p>Overall fitness is computed as the sum of all normalized response values over
all metrics over all time</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[F=\sum_{metrics}{n_m\ast \Delta t}\;\;\;\;\;\; \forall \; \Delta t \; in \; simulation \; duration\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n_m\)</span> is the normalized value for the metric in the time period
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Delta t\)</span>.</p>
